Welcome to my blog!

Since I'm always learning something new, it's impossible to remember everything in detail. Sometimes I get information from various places and don't remember exactly where I've founded it. Now, I want to keep some of these things written. Those are the purpose of this blog: be an **archive** while make me **practice my English**.

## Who am I? ##
