I"­<p>Welcome to my blog!<br />
Since Iâ€™m always learning something new, itâ€™s impossible to remember everything in detail. Sometimes I get information from various places and donâ€™t remember exactly where Iâ€™ve founded it. Now, I want some of these things written when I can go back and donâ€™t forget. Those are the purpose of this blog: be an <strong>archive</strong> while make me <strong>practice my English</strong>.</p>
